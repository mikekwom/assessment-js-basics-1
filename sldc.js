// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development
    Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.
